## Using multiple templates can be achieved using the following
Please go the the `Preview` tab and select the appropriate sub-template:

* [Group A](?expand=1&template=group_a_template.md)
* [Group B](?expand=1&template=group_b_template.md)

Alternativley, if you would like a different PR on a per repo basis, you can add a _pull_request_template.md_ file for each repo that overwirtes this default PR template.
